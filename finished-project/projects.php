			<p>For project one, we had to write the HTML for a fictional restaurant based on one of our classmates. Blah, blah, blah.</p>

				<h1>Restaurant Website</h1>
				<img src="images/restaurantsite.png" alt="A screenshot of a finished restaurant website.">
			</a>
			<p>For project two, we had to take the HTML we had written, style it using CSS and create a menu page. In the end, we had a website that looks like an actual restaurant could use it! Blah, blah, blah.</p>
