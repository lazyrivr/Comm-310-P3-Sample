		<h1>Homework</h1>
		<p>This page should include a link to every homework assignment done in this class. If you have time, it might be wise to take screenshots of some of the assignments so that there's visual interest and it isn't boring. I don't have time, so here's a list!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Early homework</li>
			<li>Later homework</li>
			<li>Homework where I'm starting to get it!</li>
			<li>You get the idea.</li>
		</ul>
