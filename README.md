Comm 310 Project 3 Sample
=========================

Sometimes it's just way easier to work with real code when showing students how to do things. This repo contains a couple different versions of a sample version of the third and final project for the Comm 310 class at BYU-Idaho, with Brother Judkins as the teacher. (Project requirements might change with other teachers.)

This project is based on the following requirements from Brother Judkins' 310 syllabus for the Spring 2013 semester:

# Project Description

As described at the beginning of the semester, the third project we will do this semester is the "Comm 310 Content Project." All content from class will ultimately end up on this project. Your notes from the first day of class, for example, will become part of the Comm310 project.

# Requirements

1. HTML Requirements:
* lint-free HTML5
* home (basically the home or index page of the project)
* people (an area that will keep interesting information about each member of our class)
* notes (obviously, where you will keep class notes)
* homework (links to every homework assignment and in-class exercise we ever do)
* projects (links to all of the projects)
* about (a single page explaining the core of Comm 310 from your unique persepective - don't copy and paste this from anywhere. Write it and re-write it yourself over the course of the semester.)
2. PHP Requirements:
* Modular and site-universal nav on every page
* Modular header
* Modular footer
3. CSS Requirements:
* Vision/Mockup/Design/Goal Document
* Consistent look & feel on every page. Should not look the same as your restaurant project.
* Professional
* Attention-to-details design
* Well-organized, user-friendly, easy to find information
4. FTP Requirements:
* Site homepage must be live at yourdomain/310/
* All other pages must be findable/linked to homepage

# Disclaimers

The sample project in this repo is going to take shortcuts. Not every page will be present (at least at first), the design may be nothing to write home about, and I will not look over the code to check it as carefully as if my grade was on the line with this project. This is simply an aid to help me with tutoring!
